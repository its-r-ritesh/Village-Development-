            Rural villages surrounding to the industrial belt, have none or inadequate sources of safe drinking water. SVADES has initiated as well as commissioned village level water supply schemes.

                India has many initiatives to develop education and skills, including the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS). PMKVY is the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship's flagship program, which aims to train young people in skills across the country. As of September 2021, PMKVY has trained more than 13 million people in various sectors. JSS, which is implemented by NGOs, provides vocational training to non-literates, neo-literates, and school dropouts in rural areas. <br><br>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid shift to digital-learning models, which has increased the need for digital assets, infrastructure, upskilling of teachers, and content. The Indian education and skill development sector has also seen an accelerated growth. <br><br>
                90% of jobs in India are skill-based, though only 6% of the workforce is trained. Skill development can help students develop holistic skills, such as adaptability, entrepreneurship, problem-solving abilities, self-confidence, and life skills. This can help students prepare to thrive in a competitive world where versatility and adaptability are highly prized.

                India's rural health care system is made up of three tiers, including Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs), and mobile dispensaries. PHCs are the first point of contact for the village community and the medical officer, and they provide preventive and curative health care to the rural population. CHCs are referral centers for four PHCs and provide facilities for specialist consultations and obstetric care. CHCs have 30 in-door beds, one OT, X-ray, labor room, and laboratory facilities. Mobile dispensaries also provide people with access to good health treatment.<br><br>
                
                The government also provides public health facilities in villages, including: Panchayat hospitals, Free medicines, and Cataract camps. <br><br>
                
                PHCs are established and maintained by the State Governments under the Minimum Needs Programme (MNP)/ Basic Minimum Services Programme (BMS). PHCs are trained in dealing with common illnesses under the supervision of a doctor. Village health workers provide counseling and evaluate psychological problems, referring patients with serious mental illness to health professionals. <br><br>
